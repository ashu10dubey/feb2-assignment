    "Q1.What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "A tuple is a collection of ordered, immutable, and heterogeneous elements, typically referred to as items or elements, which can be of any type, including other tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are similar to lists, but there are some key differences between the two. Here are some of the main characteristics of tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutability: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This makes tuples more memory efficient and secure than lists, as they cannot be accidentally modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Order: The elements in a tuple are ordered, meaning that their position in the tuple is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous elements: Tuples can contain elements of different data types, including other tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing elements: Elements of a tuple can be accessed using an index, just like in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Named tuples: Tuples can also be given names, making them easier to read and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, yes, a tuple is immutable\n",
